 * At a block height of 400k, this gives us a size of 138,964.
 * The constants this calculation arise from can be seen below, or in
 * src/CryptoNoteCore/Currency.cpp::maxBlockCumulativeSize(). Call this value
 * x.
 *
 * Next, calculate the median size of the last 100 blocks. Take the max of
 * this value, and 100,000. Multiply this value by 1.25. Call this value y.
 *
 * Finally, return the minimum of x and y.
 *
 * Or, in short: min(140k (slowly rising), 1.25 * max(100k, median(last 100 blocks size)))
 * Block size will always be 125k or greater (Assuming non testnet)
 *
 * To get the max transaction size, remove 600 from this value, for the
 * reserved miner transaction.
 *
 * We are going to ignore the median(last 100 blocks size), as it is possible
 * for a transaction to be valid for inclusion in a block when it is submitted,
 * but not when it actually comes to be mined, for example if the median
 * block size suddenly decreases. This gives a bit of a lower cap of max
 * tx sizes, but prevents anything getting stuck in the pool.
